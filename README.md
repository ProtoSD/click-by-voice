### Click by Voice

This Chrome browser extension is being developed to provide support
for activating links and other HTML elements using voice commands.


## Using Click by Voice manually

Click by Voice provides two keyboard shortcuts, which are bound by
default to `{ctrl+shift+space}` (pop up command window) and
{ctrl+shift+,} (blur).  You can rebind these as desired using the
keyboard shortcuts link at the bottom of the <a
href="chrome://extensions/">extensions page</a>.
